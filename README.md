# SIC Assembler App

A web-based assembler for the **Simplified Instructional Computer (SIC)** architecture. This tool allows users to input SIC assembly code, perform Pass 1 and Pass 2 of the assembler process, and generate object code, symbol tables, and listing files‚Äîall from a user-friendly interface.

## Assembler Workflow
The app simulates a two-pass SIC assembler:

### Pass 1:
- Reads each line of the program
- Assigns location counter (LOCCTR)
- Creates the symbol table (SYMTAB)
- Produces intermediate file

### Pass 2:
- Uses the intermediate file and SYMTAB
- Generates object code and handles address resolution
- Outputs:
  - Object Program
  - Listing File
